# Multi Cloud Shell

**BETA VERSION**

This repository provides a container image providing a multi cloud shell for AWS, Google and Azure. The core components of that image are:

* `gcloud` cli for Google
* `aws` cli for AWS
* `az` cli for Azure
* plus all additional tools and command line interfaces to manage kubernetes clusters

Persistence is provided by a mapped working directory on your docker host. That means, you can easily destroy and rebuild the image whenever needed. If you want to move your setup, simply tar / zip your local repo directory including the workdir.
